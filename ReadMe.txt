Features considered for next steps and Open Items
------------------------------------------------
- Containerised Micro service Deployment architecture (Not in scope)- Dockerize tomcat with application deployed +Couch DB .  Couch DB runs in the same docker instance, MultiAZ would be achieved with CouchBD cluster replication syncronization between each Docker instance , while application 
- Server less deployment (Not in scope)- AWS lambda integration with JAX-RS services built via an adapter, CouchDB cluster deployed externally . API Gateway provides gateway fa√ßade for REST integration API
- Authentication and Authorization info is still internal and needs to be externalized
